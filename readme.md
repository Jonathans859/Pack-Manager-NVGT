# Pack Manager for NVGT
An utility for the [Nonvisual Gaming Toolkit](https://nvgt.dev) to create and extract pack files of your NVGT applications using the pack_file class (sqlite_pack planned).

# Disclaimer
I'm not discontinuing this for now, but would like to mention that this is far from being complete or usable other than for basic pack creation (no extraction whatsoever, and that I don't think I have the motivation and capacity to add this in the near future.) Pull requests are appreciated and will be reviewed nevertheless.
